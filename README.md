# mondrian-animated-portfolio

A small experimental portfolio site using a Piet Mondrian–inspired grid layout.  
The grid stays fixed while different panels change color and content as you scroll, revealing short notes about who I am and what I make (games, creative coding, etc.).

## Live Demo

## Features

-   Scroll-driven text and color transitions within fixed panels
-   Simple portfolio teaser with links to my work (GitHub, p5.js)
